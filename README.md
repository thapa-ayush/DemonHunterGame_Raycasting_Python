# Demon Hunter Game

Hey there! This is my Python game project where you hunt demons in a 3D world. I made it using Pygame and added some cool features to make it fun to play.

## What's in the Game

- First-person shooter in a 3D world
- Different types of demons to fight
- Cool weapon effects and animations
- Health and stamina system
- Minimap to help you navigate

## How to Play

Just use these controls:

- WASD - Move around
- Mouse - Look around
- Left Click - Shoot
- Shift - Sprint
- R - Reload
- ESC - Quit

The goal is simple: take out all the demons to win! But watch your health - if you die, you'll have to start over.

## Setting Up

1. You'll need Python installed on your computer
2. Install Pygame:

```
pip install pygame
```

3. Run the game:

```
python main.py
```

## Game Tips

- Keep moving to dodge demon attacks
- Listen for demon sounds - they'll tell you where they are
- Use sprint to quickly get away from tough situations
- Remember to reload when you're safe
- Use the walls for cover
- Watch your health bar - if it gets low, take a break to heal

## How It Works

The game uses these main parts:

- main.py - Runs everything
- player.py - Handles movement and shooting
- weapon.py - Manages the gun mechanics
- npc.py - Controls the demons
- map.py - Creates the game world
- settings.py - All the game settings

## Credits

All the game assets (sprites, sounds, textures) are in the resources folder:

- resources/sprites/ - All game characters and objects
- resources/sound/ - Game audio
- resources/textures/ - Wall and effect textures

## Known Issues

- Sometimes demons might get stuck on corners
- Footstep sounds might overlap during sprinting
- Screen shake might feel too strong for some players

Feel free to try it out and let me know what you think! This was a fun project to work on and I learned a lot about game development while making it.
